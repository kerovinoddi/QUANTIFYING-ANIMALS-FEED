      <h1><em>WHY QUANTIFY YOUR ANIMALS FEED?</em></h1><br><br>
      <p>This web page have been developed to help eradicate death of animals over this years the rate at which the
        animals have been
        dying is alarming. Due to this reason I sees it wise to come up with measures that will help to conserve our
        livestock and
        wild animals.
      </p>
      <p>The ideology of quantifying animals feed is good and by this just like we budget for our selves we can budget
        for
        our wild animals since they earns us income just like domestic animals does.
      </p>
      <p> For good health animal at home their movements should be restricteted that is their grazing land at home
        should be devided into paddocks.
        they should graze rotationally. To do this the following tools are necessary :asckle or apanga.</p>

  <p>This web page have been developed to help eradicate death of animals  over this years the rate at which the animals have been

    wild animals. 
  </p>
  <p>The ideology of quantifying animals feed is good and by this just like we budget for our selves we can budget for

  </p>
  <p> For good health animal at home their movements should be restricteted that is their grazing land at home should be devided into paddocks.
    they should graze rotationally. To do this the following tools are necessary :asckle or apanga.</p>
  <h2 style="font-size:medium;">How to quantify.</h>
    <ol>
      <li>Select asection in the field that measures (10*10)metres,then.</li>
      <li>Use transverse method of sampling by collecting grass samples(zigzag method)</li>
      <li>Measure height of these grasses,then find the average heiht of the grass that you have collected mark this value (x)</li>
      <li>Release the animals to go and graze and after that recollect some samples and measure there height and find the 
        average height mark this value(y)</li>
        <li>Find the difference in heights and record it as a daily height consumption </li>
       <p> This will make us know what quantity a cow will graze on in adaily basis.Through this knowledge the farmer will know that 
        even if it is amatter of preparing hay for future use he shall have known what quantity to  keep for the drought </p>  
        And to animals in parks then institutins respo sible can even irrigate large track of land i.e after
         estimating the area of land  grazed on by the animals.
         This will make us preserve the endangered species of animals like the roan antellope.
         this will also make the animals to be easily accessed by a tourist if atall they were interested in specific animals.
